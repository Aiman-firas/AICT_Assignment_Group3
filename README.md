# **Intelligent Transportation System (AICT Group 3 Project)**

This project is an **Intelligent Transportation System** designed to assist with:

- **Shortest Route Planning** (Part 2.1)
- **Logical Inference for Route Adjustments** (Part 2.2)
- **Traffic Prediction using Bayesian Networks** (Part 2.3)

The system helps users find the shortest path between two locations using various search algorithms and integrates logical reasoning and traffic prediction to provide optimal travel recommendations.

## **Features**

### **Shortest Route Planning (Part 2.1)**

- Implements **BFS**, **DFS**, **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**, and **A\*** algorithms.
- Compares performance (runtime and paths) for all algorithms.
- Provides a user interface for dynamic route selection.

### **Logical Inference (Part 2.2)**

- Integrates route planning with logical reasoning to adjust paths based on predefined conditions like weather, traffic, or time.

### **Traffic Prediction (Part 2.3)**

- Uses Bayesian Networks to predict traffic conditions and recommend routes.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8+**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Required Libraries**: Install the dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
